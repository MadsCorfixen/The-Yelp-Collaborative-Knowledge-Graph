    Take a pd.dataframe with two columns ["latitude", "longitude"] and update the locations to the neighbourhood level
    using the geopy library to reverse search this coordinate set, rounded to the coordinate_rounding.

    Args:
        df (pd.DataFrame): A dataframe with two columns ["latitude", "longitude"]
        coordinate_rounding (int, optional): The number of decimal places to round the coordinates to. Defaults to 2.
        min_delay_seconds (int, optional): The minimum delay between requests to the geopy API. Defaults to 2.
        zoom_level (int, optional): The zoom level to use when reverse searching the coordinates. Defaults to 14.
        report_missing (bool, optional): Whether to report missing locations. Defaults to False.
